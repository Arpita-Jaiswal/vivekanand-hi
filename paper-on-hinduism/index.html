    "value": "Three religions now stand in the world which have came down to us from time prehistoric — Hinduism, Zoroastrianism\nand Judaism. They have all received tremendous shocks and all of them prove by their survival their internal strength.\nBut while Judaism failed to absorb Christianity and was driven out of its place of birth by its all-conquering\ndaughter, and a handful of Parsees is all that remains to tell the tale of their grand religion, sect after sect arose\nin India and seemed to shake the religion of the Vedas to its very foundations, but like the waters of the seashore\nin a tremendous earthquake it receded only for a while, only to return in an all-absorbing flood, a thousand times more\nvigorous, and when the tumult of the rush was over, these sects were all sucked in, absorbed, and assimilated into\nthe immense body of the mother faith.\n\n\nFrom the high spiritual flights of the Vedanta philosophy, of which the latest discoveries of science seem like echoes,\nto the low ideas of idolatry with its multifarious mythology, the agnosticism of the Buddhists, and the atheism of the\nJains, each and all have a place in the Hindu's religion.\n\n\nWhere then, the question arises, where is the common centre to which all these widely diverging radii converge? Where\nis the common basis upon which all these seemingly hopeless contradictions rest? And this is the question I shall\nattempt to answer.\n\n\nThe Hindus have received their religion through revelation, the Vedas. They hold that the Vedas are without beginning\nand without end. It may sound ludicrous to this audience, how a book can be without beginning or end. But by the Vedas\nno books are meant. They mean the accumulated treasury of spiritual laws discovered by different persons in different\ntimes. Just as the law of gravitation existed before its discovery, and would exist if all humanity forgot it, so is it\nwith the laws that govern the spiritual world. The moral, ethical, and spiritual relations between soul and soul and\nbetween individual spirits and the Father of all spirits, were there before their discovery, and would remain even if\nwe forgot them.\n\n\nThe discoverers of these laws are called Rishis, and we honour them as perfected beings. I am glad to tell this audience\nthat some of the very greatest of them were women. Here it may be said that these laws as laws may be without end,\nbut they must have had a beginning. The Vedas teach us that creation is without beginning or end. Science is said to\nhave proved that the sum total of cosmic energy is always the same. Then, if there was a time when nothing existed,\nwhere was all this manifested energy? Some say it was in a potential form in God. In that case God is sometimes\npotential and sometimes kinetic, which would make Him mutable. Everything mutable is a compound, and everything\ncompound must undergo that change which is called destruction. So God would die, which is absurd. Therefore there\nnever was a time when there was no creation.\n\n\nIf I may be allowed to use a simile, creation and creator are two lines, without beginning and without end, running\nparallel to each other. God is the ever active providence, by whose power systems after systems are being evolved out\nof chaos, made to run for a time and again destroyed. This is what the Brâhmin boy repeats every day: \"The sun and the\nmoon, the Lord created like the suns and moons of previous cycles.\" And this agrees with modern science.\n\n\nHere I stand and if I shut my eyes, and try to conceive my existence, \"I\", \"I\", \"I\", what is the idea before me? The\nidea of a body. Am I, then, nothing but a combination of material substances? The Vedas declare, “No”. I am a spirit\nliving in a body. I am not the body. The body will die, but I shall not die. Here am I in this body; it will fall, but\nI shall go on living. I had also a past. The soul was not created, for creation means a combination which means a\ncertain future dissolution. If then the soul was created, it must die. Some are born happy, enjoy perfect health, with\nbeautiful body, mental vigour and all wants supplied. Others are born miserable, some are without hands or feet,\nothers again are idiots and only drag on a wretched existence. Why, if they are all created, why does a just and\nmerciful God create one happy and another unhappy, why is He so partial? Nor would it mend matters in the least to\nhold that those who are miserable in this life will be happy in a future one. Why should a man be miserable even here\nin the reign of a just and merciful God?\n\n\nIn the second place, the idea of a creator God does not explain the anomaly, but simply expresses the cruel fiat of an\nall-powerful being. There must have been causes, then, before his birth, to make a man miserable or happy and those\nwere his past actions.\n\n\nAre not all the tendencies of the mind and the body accounted for by inherited aptitude? Here are two parallel lines\nof existence — one of the mind, the other of matter. If matter and its transformations answer for all that we have,\nthere is no necessity for supposing the existence of a soul. But it cannot be proved that thought has been evolved out\nof matter, and if a philosophical monism is inevitable, spiritual monism is certainly logical and no less desirable\nthan a materialistic monism; but neither of these is necessary here.\n\n\nWe cannot deny that bodies acquire certain tendencies from heredity, but those tendencies only mean the physical\nconfiguration, through which a peculiar mind alone can act in a peculiar way. There are other tendencies peculiar to\na soul caused by its past actions. And a soul with a certain tendency would by the laws of affinity take birth in a\nbody which is the fittest instrument for the display of that tendency. This is in accord with science, for science\nwants to explain everything by habit, and habit is got through repetitions. So repetitions are necessary to explain\nthe natural habits of a new-born soul. And since they were not obtained in this present life, they must have come down\nfrom past lives.\n\n\nThere is another suggestion. Taking all these for granted, how is it that I do not remember anything of my past life ?\n This can be easily explained. I am now speaking English. It is not my mother tongue, in fact no words of my mother\n tongue are now present in my consciousness; but let me try to bring them up, and they rush in. That shows that\n consciousness is only the surface of the mental ocean, and within its depths are stored up all our experiences. Try\n and struggle, they would come up and you would be conscious even of your past life.\n\n\nThis is direct and demonstrative evidence. Verification is the perfect proof of a theory, and here is the challenge\nthrown to the world by the Rishis. We have discovered the secret by which the very depths of the ocean of memory can\nbe stirred up — try it and you would get a complete reminiscence of your past life.\n\n\nSo then the Hindu believes that he is a spirit. Him the sword cannot pierce — him the fire cannot burn — him the water\ncannot melt — him the air cannot dry. The Hindu believes that every soul is a circle whose circumference is nowhere,\nbut whose centre is located in the body, and that death means the change of this centre from body to body. Nor is the\nsoul bound by the conditions of matter. In its very essence it is free, unbounded, holy, pure, and perfect. But\nsomehow or other it finds itself tied down to matter, and thinks of itself as matter.\n\n\nWhy should the free, perfect, and pure being be thus under the thraldom of matter, is the next question. How can the\nperfect soul be deluded into the belief that it is imperfect? We have been told that the Hindus shirk the question\nand say that no such question can be there. Some thinkers want to answer it by positing one or more quasi-perfect\nbeings, and use big scientific names to fill up the gap. But naming is not explaining. The question remains the same.\nHow can the perfect become the quasi-perfect; how can the pure, the absolute, change even a microscopic particle of\nits nature? But the Hindu is sincere. He does not want to take shelter under sophistry. He is brave enough to face\nthe question in a manly fashion; and his answer is: “I do not know. I do not know how the perfect being, the soul,\ncame to think of itself as imperfect, as joined to and conditioned by matter.\" But the fact is a fact for all that.\nIt is a fact in everybody's consciousness that one thinks of oneself as the body. The Hindu does not attempt to\nexplain why one thinks one is the body. The answer that it is the will of God is no explanation. This is nothing more\nthan what the Hindu says, \"I do not know.\"\n\n\nWell, then, the human soul is eternal and immortal, perfect and infinite, and death means only a change of centre from\none body to another. The present is determined by our past actions, and the future by the present. The soul will go\non evolving up or reverting back from birth to birth and death to death. But here is another question: Is man a tiny\nboat in a tempest, raised one moment on the foamy crest of a billow and dashed down into a yawning chasm the next,\nrolling to and fro at the mercy of good and bad actions — a powerless, helpless wreck in an ever-raging, ever-rushing,\nuncompromising current of cause and effect; a little moth placed under the wheel of causation which rolls on crushing\neverything in its way and waits not for the widow's tears or the orphan's cry? The heart sinks at the idea, yet this\nis the law of Nature. Is there no hope? Is there no escape? — was the cry that went up from the bottom of the heart\nof despair. It reached the throne of mercy, and words of hope and consolation came down and inspired a Vedic sage,\nand he stood up before the world and in trumpet voice proclaimed the glad tidings: \"Hear, ye children of immortal\nbliss! even ye that reside in higher spheres! I have found the Ancient One who is beyond all darkness, all delusion:\nknowing Him alone you shall be saved from death over again.\" \"Children of immortal bliss\" — what a sweet, what a\nhopeful name! Allow me to call you, brethren, by that sweet name — heirs of immortal bliss — yea, the Hindu refuses\nto call you sinners. Ye are the Children of God, the sharers of immortal bliss, holy and perfect beings. Ye divinities\non earth — sinners! It is a sin to call a man so; it is a standing libel on human nature. Come up, O lions, and shake\noff the delusion that you are sheep; you are souls immortal, spirits free, blest and eternal; ye are not matter,\nye are not bodies; matter is your servant, not you the servant of matter.\n\n\nThus it is that the Vedas proclaim not a dreadful combination of unforgiving laws, not an endless prison of cause\nand effect, but that at the head of all these laws, in and through every particle of matter and force, stands One\n\"by whose command the wind blows, the fire burns, the clouds rain, and death stalks upon the earth.\"\n\n\nAnd what is His nature?\n\n\nHe is everywhere, the pure and formless One, the Almighty and the All-merciful. \"Thou art our father, Thou art our\nmother, Thou art our beloved friend, Thou art the source of all strength; give us strength. Thou art He that beareth\nthe burdens of the universe; help me bear the little burden of this life.\" Thus sang the Rishis of the Vedas. And how\nto worship Him? Through love. \"He is to be worshipped as the one beloved, dearer than everything in this and the next\nlife.\"\n\n\nThis is the doctrine of love declared in the Vedas, and let us see how it is fully developed and taught by Krishna,\nwhom the Hindus believe to have been God incarnate on earth.\n\n\nHe taught that a man ought to live in this world like a lotus leaf, which grows in water but is never moistened by\nwater; so a man ought to live in the world — his heart to God and his hands to work.\n\n\nIt is good to love God for hope of reward in this or the next world, but it is better to love God for love's sake, and\nthe prayer goes: \"Lord, I do not want wealth, nor children, nor learning. If it be Thy will, I shall go from birth\nto birth, but grant me this, that I may love Thee without the hope of reward — love unselfishly for love's sake.\"\nOne of the disciples of Krishna, the then Emperor of India, was driven from his kingdom by his enemies and had to take\nshelter with his queen in a forest in the Himalayas, and there one day the queen asked him how it was that he, the\nmost virtuous of men, should suffer so much misery. Yudhishthira answered, \"Behold, my queen, the Himalayas, how grand\nand beautiful they are; I love them. They do not give me anything, but my nature is to love the grand, the beautiful,\ntherefore I love them. Similarly, I love the Lord. He is the source of all beauty, of all sublimity. He is the only\nobject to be loved; my nature is to love Him, and therefore I love. I do not pray for anything; I do not ask for\nanything. Let Him place me wherever He likes. I must love Him for love's sake. I cannot trade in love.\"\n\n\nThe Vedas teach that the soul is divine, only held in the bondage of matter; perfection will be reached when this bond\nwill burst, and the word they use for it is therefore, Mukti — freedom, freedom from the bonds of imperfection,\nfreedom from death and misery.\n\n\nAnd this bondage can only fall off through the mercy of God, and this mercy comes on the pure. So purity is the\ncondition of His mercy. How does that mercy act? He reveals Himself to the pure heart; the pure and the stainless\nsee God, yea, even in this life; then and then only all the crookedness of the heart is made straight. Then all doubt\nceases. He is no more the freak of a terrible law of causation. This is the very centre, the very vital conception of\nHinduism. The Hindu does not want to live upon words and theories. If there are existences beyond the ordinary\nsensuous existence, he wants to come face to face with them. If there is a soul in him which is not matter, if there\nis an all-merciful universal Soul, he will go to Him direct. He must see Him, and that alone can destroy all doubts.\nSo the best proof a Hindu sage gives about the soul, about God, is: \"I have seen the soul; I have seen God.\" And that\nis the only condition of perfection. The Hindu religion does not consist in struggles and attempts to believe a\ncertain doctrine or dogma, but in realising — not in believing, but in being and becoming.\n\n\nThus the whole object of their system is by constant struggle to become perfect, to become divine, to reach God and\nsee God, and this reaching God, seeing God, becoming perfect even as the Father in Heaven is perfect, constitutes the\nreligion of the Hindus.\n\n\nAnd what becomes of a man when he attains perfection? He lives a life of bliss infinite. He enjoys infinite and perfect\nbliss, having obtained the only thing in which man ought to have pleasure, namely God, and enjoys the bliss with God.\n\n\nSo far all the Hindus are agreed. This is the common religion of all the sects of India; but, then, perfection is\nabsolute, and the absolute cannot be two or three. It cannot have any qualities. It cannot be an individual. And so\nwhen a soul becomes perfect and absolute, it must become one with Brahman, and it would only realise the Lord as the\nperfection, the reality, of its own nature and existence, the existence absolute, knowledge absolute, and bliss\nabsolute. We have often and often read this called the losing of individuality and becoming a stock or a stone.\n\n\n“He jests at scars that never felt a wound.”\n\n\nI tell you it is nothing of the kind. If it is happiness to enjoy the consciousness of this small body, it must be\ngreater happiness to enjoy the consciousness of two bodies, the measure of happiness increasing with the consciousness\nof an increasing number of bodies, the aim, the ultimate of happiness being reached when it would become a universal\nconsciousness.\n\n\nTherefore, to gain this infinite universal individuality, this miserable little prison-individuality must go.\nThen alone can death cease when I am alone with life, then alone can misery cease when I am one with happiness itself,\nthen alone can all errors cease when I am one with knowledge itself; and this is the necessary scientific conclusion.\nScience has proved to me that physical individuality is a delusion, that really my body is one little continuously\nchanging body in an unbroken ocean of matter; and Advaita (unity) is the necessary conclusion with my other\ncounterpart, soul.\n\n\nScience is nothing but the finding of unity. As soon as science would reach perfect unity, it would stop from further\nprogress, because it would reach the goal. Thus Chemistry could not progress farther when it would discover one\nelement out of which all other could be made. Physics would stop when it would be able to fulfill its services in\ndiscovering one energy of which all others are but manifestations, and the science of religion become perfect when\nit would discover Him who is the one life in a universe of death, Him who is the constant basis of an ever-changing\nworld. One who is the only Soul of which all souls are but delusive manifestations. Thus is it, through multiplicity\nand duality, that the ultimate unity is reached. Religion can go no farther. This is the goal of all science.\n\n\nAll science is bound to come to this conclusion in the long run. Manifestation, and not creation, is the word of\nscience today, and the Hindu is only glad that what he has been cherishing in his bosom for ages is going to be\ntaught in more forcible language, and with further light from the latest conclusions of science.\n\n\nDescend we now from the aspirations of philosophy to the religion of the ignorant. At the very outset, I may tell\nyou that there is no polytheism in India. In every temple, if one stands by and listens, one will find the worshippers\napplying all the attributes of God, including omnipresence, to the images. It is not polytheism, nor would the name\nhenotheism explain the situation. \"The rose called by any other name would smell as sweet.\" Names are not explanations.\n\n\nI remember, as a boy, hearing a Christian missionary preach to a crowd in India. Among other sweet things he was\ntelling them was that if he gave a blow to their idol with his stick, what could it do? One of his hearers sharply\nanswered, \"If I abuse your God, what can He do?\" “You would be punished,” said the preacher, \"when you die.\" \"So my\nidol will punish you when you die,\" retorted the Hindu.\n\n\nThe tree is known by its fruits. When I have seen amongst them that are called idolaters, men, the like of whom in\nmorality and spirituality and love I have never seen anywhere, I stop and ask myself, \"Can sin beget holiness?\"\n\n\nSuperstition is a great enemy of man, but bigotry is worse. Why does a Christian go to church? Why is the cross holy?\nWhy is the face turned toward the sky in prayer? Why are there so many images in the Catholic Church? Why are there\nso many images in the minds of Protestants when they pray? My brethren, we can no more think about anything without\na mental image than we can live without breathing. By the law of association, the material image calls up the mental\nidea and vice versa. This is why the Hindu uses an external symbol when he worships. He will tell you, it helps to\nkeep his mind fixed on the Being to whom he prays. He knows as well as you do that the image is not God, is not\nomnipresent. After all, how much does omnipresence mean to almost the whole world? It stands merely as a word,\na symbol. Has God superficial area? If not, when we repeat that word \"omnipresent\", we think of the extended sky or\nof space, that is all.\n\n\nAs we find that somehow or other, by the laws of our mental constitution, we have to associate our ideas of infinity\nwith the image of the blue sky, or of the sea, so we naturally connect our idea of holiness with the image of a\nchurch, a mosque, or a cross. The Hindus have associated the idea of holiness, purity, truth, omnipresence, and such\nother ideas with different images and forms. But with this difference that while some people devote their whole lives\nto their idol of a church and never rise higher, because with them religion means an intellectual assent to certain\ndoctrines and doing good to their fellows, the whole religion of the Hindu is centred in realisation. Man is to become\ndivine by realising the divine. Idols or temples or churches or books are only the supports, the helps, of his\nspiritual childhood: but on and on he must progress.\n\n\nHe must not stop anywhere. \"External worship, material worship,\" say the scriptures, \"is the lowest stage;\nstruggling to rise high, mental prayer is the next stage, but the highest stage is when the Lord has been realised.\"\nMark, the same earnest man who is kneeling before the idol tells you, \"Him the Sun cannot express, nor the moon, nor\nthe stars, the lightning cannot express Him, nor what we speak of as fire; through Him they shine.\" But he does not\nabuse any one's idol or call its worship sin. He recognises in it a necessary stage of life. \"The child is father of\nthe man.\" Would it be right for an old man to say that childhood is a sin or youth a sin?\n\n\nIf a man can realise his divine nature with the help of an image, would it be right to call that a sin? Nor even when\nhe has passed that stage, should he call it an error. To the Hindu, man is not travelling from error to truth, but\nfrom truth to truth, from lower to higher truth. To him all the religions, from the lowest fetishism to the highest\nabsolutism, mean so many attempts of the human soul to grasp and realise the Infinite, each determined by the\nconditions of its birth and association, and each of these marks a stage of progress; and every soul is a young eagle\nsoaring higher and higher, gathering more and more strength, till it reaches the Glorious Sun.\n\n\nUnity in variety is the plan of nature, and the Hindu has recognised it. Every other religion lays down certain\nfixed dogmas, and tries to force society to adopt them. It places before society only one coat which must fit Jack and\nJohn and Henry, all alike. If it does not fit John or Henry, he must go without a coat to cover his body. The Hindus\nhave discovered that the absolute can only be realised, or thought of, or stated, through the relative, and the images,\ncrosses, and crescents are simply so many symbols — so many pegs to hang the spiritual ideas on. It is not that this\nhelp is necessary for every one, but those that do not need it have no right to say that it is wrong. Nor is it\ncompulsory in Hinduism.\n\n\nOne thing I must tell you. Idolatry in India does not mean anything horrible. It is not the mother of harlots. On the\nother hand, it is the attempt of undeveloped minds to grasp high spiritual truths. The Hindus have their faults,\nthey sometimes have their exceptions; but mark this, they are always for punishing their own bodies, and never for\ncutting the throats of their neighbours. If the Hindu fanatic burns himself on the pyre, he never lights the fire of\nInquisition. And even this cannot be laid at the door of his religion any more than the burning of witches can be\nlaid at the door of Christianity.\n\n\nTo the Hindu, then, the whole world of religions is only a travelling, a coming up, of different men and women,\nthrough various conditions and circumstances, to the same goal. Every religion is only evolving a God out of the\nmaterial man, and the same God is the inspirer of all of them. Why, then, are there so many contradictions? They are\nonly apparent, says the Hindu. The contradictions come from the same truth adapting itself to the varying\ncircumstances of different natures.\n\n\nIt is the same light coming through glasses of different colours. And these little variations are necessary for\npurposes of adaptation. But in the heart of everything the same truth reigns. The Lord has declared to the Hindu in\nHis incarnation as Krishna, \"I am in every religion as the thread through a string of pearls. Wherever thou seest\nextraordinary holiness and extraordinary power raising and purifying humanity, know thou that I am there.\" And what\nhas been the result? I challenge the world to find, throughout the whole system of Sanskrit philosophy, any such\nexpression as that the Hindu alone will be saved and not others. Says Vyasa, \"We find perfect men even beyond the pale\nof our caste and creed.\" One thing more. How, then, can the Hindu, whose whole fabric of thought centres in God,\nbelieve in Buddhism which is agnostic, or in Jainism which is atheistic?\n\n\nThe Buddhists or the Jains do not depend upon God; but the whole force of their religion is directed to the great\ncentral truth in every religion, to evolve a God out of man. They have not seen the Father, but they have seen the\nSon. And he that hath seen the Son hath seen the Father also.\n\n\nThis, brethren, is a short sketch of the religious ideas of the Hindus. The Hindu may have failed to carry out all\nhis plans, but if there is ever to be a universal religion, it must be one which will have no location in place or\ntime; which will be infinite like the God it will preach, and whose sun will shine upon the followers of Krishna and\nof Christ, on saints and sinners alike; which will not be Brahminic or Buddhistic, Christian or Mohammedan, but the\nsum total of all these, and still have infinite space for development; which in its catholicity will embrace in its\ninfinite arms, and find a place for, every human being, from the lowest grovelling savage not far removed from the\nbrute, to the highest man towering by the virtues of his head and heart almost above humanity, making society stand\nin awe of him and doubt his human nature. It will be a religion which will have no place for persecution or\nintolerance in its polity, which will recognise divinity in every man and woman, and whose whole scope, whose whole\nforce, will be created in aiding humanity to realise its own true, divine nature.\n\n\nOffer such a religion, and all the nations will follow you. Asoka's council was a council of the Buddhist faith.\nAkbar's, though more to the purpose, was only a parlour-meeting. It was reserved for America to proclaim to all\nquarters of the globe that the Lord is in every religion.\n\n\nMay He who is the Brahman of the Hindus, the Ahura-Mazda of the Zoroastrians, the Buddha of the Buddhists, the\nJehovah of the Jews, the Father in Heaven of the Christians, give strength to you to carry out your noble idea!\nThe star arose in the East; it travelled steadily towards the West, sometimes dimmed and sometimes effulgent, till\nit made a circuit of the world; and now it is again rising on the very horizon of the East, the borders of the Sanpo,\na thousandfold more effulgent than it ever was before.\n\n\nHail, Columbia, motherland of liberty! It has been given to thee, who never dipped her hand in her neighbour’s blood,\nwho never found out that the shortest way of becoming rich was by robbing one’s neighbours, it has been given to thee\nto march at the vanguard of civilisation with the flag of harmony.",

Then, if there was a time when nothing existed,\nwhere was all this manifested energy? Some say it was in a potential form in God. In that case God is sometimes\npotential and sometimes kinetic, which would make Him mutable. Everything mutable is a compound, and everything\ncompound must undergo that change which is called destruction. So God would die, which is absurd. Therefore there\nnever was a time when there was no creation.\n\n\nIf I may be allowed to use a simile, creation and creator are two lines, without beginning and without end, running\nparallel to each other. God is the ever active providence, by whose power systems after systems are being evolved out\nof chaos, made to run for a time and again destroyed. This is what the Brâhmin boy repeats every day: \"The sun and the\nmoon, the Lord created like the suns and moons of previous cycles.\" And this agrees with modern science.\n\n\nHere I stand and if I shut my eyes, and try to conceive my existence, \"I\", \"I\", \"I\", what is the idea before me? The\nidea of a body. Am I, then, nothing but a combination of material substances? The Vedas declare, “No”. I am a spirit\nliving in a body. I am not the body. The body will die, but I shall not die. Here am I in this body; it will fall, but\nI shall go on living. I had also a past. The soul was not created, for creation means a combination which means a\ncertain future dissolution. If then the soul was created, it must die. Some are born happy, enjoy perfect health, with\nbeautiful body, mental vigour and all wants supplied. Others are born miserable, some are without hands or feet,\nothers again are idiots and only drag on a wretched existence. Why, if they are all created, why does a just and\nmerciful God create one happy and another unhappy, why is He so partial? Nor would it mend matters in the least to\nhold that those who are miserable in this life will be happy in a future one. Why should a man be miserable even here\nin the reign of a just and merciful God?\n\n\nIn the second place, the idea of a creator God does not explain the anomaly, but simply expresses the cruel fiat of an\nall-powerful being. There must have been causes, then, before his birth, to make a man miserable or happy and those\nwere his past actions.\n\n\nAre not all the tendencies of the mind and the body accounted for by inherited aptitude? Here are two parallel lines\nof existence — one of the mind, the other of matter. If matter and its transformations answer for all that we have,\nthere is no necessity for supposing the existence of a soul. But it cannot be proved that thought has been evolved out\nof matter, and if a philosophical monism is inevitable, spiritual monism is certainly logical and no less desirable\nthan a materialistic monism; but neither of these is necessary here.\n\n\nWe cannot deny that bodies acquire certain tendencies from heredity, but those tendencies only mean the physical\nconfiguration, through which a peculiar mind alone can act in a peculiar way. There are other tendencies peculiar to\na soul caused by its past actions. And a soul with a certain tendency would by the laws of affinity take birth in a\nbody which is the fittest instrument for the display of that tendency. This is in accord with science, for science\nwants to explain everything by habit, and habit is got through repetitions. So repetitions are necessary to explain\nthe natural habits of a new-born soul. And since they were not obtained in this present life, they must have come down\nfrom past lives.\n\n\nThere is another suggestion. Taking all these for granted, how is it that I do not remember anything of my past life ?\n This can be easily explained. I am now speaking English. It is not my mother tongue, in fact no words of my mother\n tongue are now present in my consciousness; but let me try to bring them up, and they rush in. That shows that\n consciousness is only the surface of the mental ocean, and within its depths are stored up all our experiences. Try\n and struggle, they would come up and you would be conscious even of your past life.\n\n\nThis is direct and demonstrative evidence. Verification is the perfect proof of a theory, and here is the challenge\nthrown to the world by the Rishis. We have discovered the secret by which the very depths of the ocean of memory can\nbe stirred up — try it and you would get a complete reminiscence of your past life.\n\n\nSo then the Hindu believes that he is a spirit. Him the sword cannot pierce — him the fire cannot burn — him the water\ncannot melt — him the air cannot dry. The Hindu believes that every soul is a circle whose circumference is nowhere,\nbut whose centre is located in the body, and that death means the change of this centre from body to body. Nor is the\nsoul bound by the conditions of matter. In its very essence it is free, unbounded, holy, pure, and perfect. But\nsomehow or other it finds itself tied down to matter, and thinks of itself as matter.\n\n\nWhy should the free, perfect, and pure being be thus under the thraldom of matter, is the next question. How can the\nperfect soul be deluded into the belief that it is imperfect? We have been told that the Hindus shirk the question\nand say that no such question can be there. Some thinkers want to answer it by positing one or more quasi-perfect\nbeings, and use big scientific names to fill up the gap. But naming is not explaining. The question remains the same.\nHow can the perfect become the quasi-perfect; how can the pure, the absolute, change even a microscopic particle of\nits nature? But the Hindu is sincere. He does not want to take shelter under sophistry. He is brave enough to face\nthe question in a manly fashion; and his answer is: “I do not know. I do not know how the perfect being, the soul,\ncame to think of itself as imperfect, as joined to and conditioned by matter.\" But the fact is a fact for all that.\nIt is a fact in everybody's consciousness that one thinks of oneself as the body. The Hindu does not attempt to\nexplain why one thinks one is the body. The answer that it is the will of God is no explanation. This is nothing more\nthan what the Hindu says, \"I do not know.\"\n\n\nWell, then, the human soul is eternal and immortal, perfect and infinite, and death means only a change of centre from\none body to another. The present is determined by our past actions, and the future by the present. The soul will go\non evolving up or reverting back from birth to birth and death to death. But here is another question: Is man a tiny\nboat in a tempest, raised one moment on the foamy crest of a billow and dashed down into a yawning chasm the next,\nrolling to and fro at the mercy of good and bad actions — a powerless, helpless wreck in an ever-raging, ever-rushing,\nuncompromising current of cause and effect; a little moth placed under the wheel of causation which rolls on crushing\neverything in its way and waits not for the widow's tears or the orphan's cry? The heart sinks at the idea, yet this\nis the law of Nature. Is there no hope? Is there no escape? — was the cry that went up from the bottom of the heart\nof despair. It reached the throne of mercy, and words of hope and consolation came down and inspired a Vedic sage,\nand he stood up before the world and in trumpet voice proclaimed the glad tidings: \"Hear, ye children of immortal\nbliss! even ye that reside in higher spheres! I have found the Ancient One who is beyond all darkness, all delusion:\nknowing Him alone you shall be saved from death over again.\" \"Children of immortal bliss\" — what a sweet, what a\nhopeful name! Allow me to call you, brethren, by that sweet name — heirs of immortal bliss — yea, the Hindu refuses\nto call you sinners. Ye are the Children of God, the sharers of immortal bliss, holy and perfect beings. Ye divinities\non earth — sinners! It is a sin to call a man so; it is a standing libel on human nature. Come up, O lions, and shake\noff the delusion that you are sheep; you are souls immortal, spirits free, blest and eternal; ye are not matter,\nye are not bodies; matter is your servant, not you the servant of matter.\n\n\nThus it is that the Vedas proclaim not a dreadful combination of unforgiving laws, not an endless prison of cause\nand effect, but that at the head of all these laws, in and through every particle of matter and force, stands One\n\"by whose command the wind blows, the fire burns, the clouds rain, and death stalks upon the earth.\"\n\n\nAnd what is His nature?\n\n\nHe is everywhere, the pure and formless One, the Almighty and the All-merciful. \"Thou art our father, Thou art our\nmother, Thou art our beloved friend, Thou art the source of all strength; give us strength. Thou art He that beareth\nthe burdens of the universe; help me bear the little burden of this life.\" Thus sang the Rishis of the Vedas. And how\nto worship Him? Through love. \"He is to be worshipped as the one beloved, dearer than everything in this and the next\nlife.\"\n\n\nThis is the doctrine of love declared in the Vedas, and let us see how it is fully developed and taught by Krishna,\nwhom the Hindus believe to have been God incarnate on earth.\n\n\nHe taught that a man ought to live in this world like a lotus leaf, which grows in water but is never moistened by\nwater; so a man ought to live in the world — his heart to God and his hands to work.\n\n\nIt is good to love God for hope of reward in this or the next world, but it is better to love God for love's sake, and\nthe prayer goes: \"Lord, I do not want wealth, nor children, nor learning. If it be Thy will, I shall go from birth\nto birth, but grant me this, that I may love Thee without the hope of reward — love unselfishly for love's sake.\"\nOne of the disciples of Krishna, the then Emperor of India, was driven from his kingdom by his enemies and had to take\nshelter with his queen in a forest in the Himalayas, and there one day the queen asked him how it was that he, the\nmost virtuous of men, should suffer so much misery. Yudhishthira answered, \"Behold, my queen, the Himalayas, how grand\nand beautiful they are; I love them. They do not give me anything, but my nature is to love the grand, the beautiful,\ntherefore I love them. Similarly, I love the Lord. He is the source of all beauty, of all sublimity. He is the only\nobject to be loved; my nature is to love Him, and therefore I love. I do not pray for anything; I do not ask for\nanything. Let Him place me wherever He likes. I must love Him for love's sake. I cannot trade in love.\"\n\n\nThe Vedas teach that the soul is divine, only held in the bondage of matter; perfection will be reached when this bond\nwill burst, and the word they use for it is therefore, Mukti — freedom, freedom from the bonds of imperfection,\nfreedom from death and misery.\n\n\nAnd this bondage can only fall off through the mercy of God, and this mercy comes on the pure. So purity is the\ncondition of His mercy. How does that mercy act? He reveals Himself to the pure heart; the pure and the stainless\nsee God, yea, even in this life; then and then only all the crookedness of the heart is made straight. Then all doubt\nceases. He is no more the freak of a terrible law of causation. This is the very centre, the very vital conception of\nHinduism. The Hindu does not want to live upon words and theories. If there are existences beyond the ordinary\nsensuous existence, he wants to come face to face with them. If there is a soul in him which is not matter, if there\nis an all-merciful universal Soul, he will go to Him direct. He must see Him, and that alone can destroy all doubts.\nSo the best proof a Hindu sage gives about the soul, about God, is: \"I have seen the soul; I have seen God.\" And that\nis the only condition of perfection. The Hindu religion does not consist in struggles and attempts to believe a\ncertain doctrine or dogma, but in realising — not in believing, but in being and becoming.\n\n\nThus the whole object of their system is by constant struggle to become perfect, to become divine, to reach God and\nsee God, and this reaching God, seeing God, becoming perfect even as the Father in Heaven is perfect, constitutes the\nreligion of the Hindus.\n\n\nAnd what becomes of a man when he attains perfection? He lives a life of bliss infinite. He enjoys infinite and perfect\nbliss, having obtained the only thing in which man ought to have pleasure, namely God, and enjoys the bliss with God.\n\n\nSo far all the Hindus are agreed. This is the common religion of all the sects of India; but, then, perfection is\nabsolute, and the absolute cannot be two or three. It cannot have any qualities. It cannot be an individual. And so\nwhen a soul becomes perfect and absolute, it must become one with Brahman, and it would only realise the Lord as the\nperfection, the reality, of its own nature and existence, the existence absolute, knowledge absolute, and bliss\nabsolute. We have often and often read this called the losing of individuality and becoming a stock or a stone.\n\n\n“He jests at scars that never felt a wound.”\n\n\nI tell you it is nothing of the kind. If it is happiness to enjoy the consciousness of this small body, it must be\ngreater happiness to enjoy the consciousness of two bodies, the measure of happiness increasing with the consciousness\nof an increasing number of bodies, the aim, the ultimate of happiness being reached when it would become a universal\nconsciousness.\n\n\nTherefore, to gain this infinite universal individuality, this miserable little prison-individuality must go.\nThen alone can death cease when I am alone with life, then alone can misery cease when I am one with happiness itself,\nthen alone can all errors cease when I am one with knowledge itself; and this is the necessary scientific conclusion.\nScience has proved to me that physical individuality is a delusion, that really my body is one little continuously\nchanging body in an unbroken ocean of matter; and Advaita (unity) is the necessary conclusion with my other\ncounterpart, soul.\n\n\nScience is nothing but the finding of unity. As soon as science would reach perfect unity, it would stop from further\nprogress, because it would reach the goal. Thus Chemistry could not progress farther when it would discover one\nelement out of which all other could be made. Physics would stop when it would be able to fulfill its services in\ndiscovering one energy of which all others are but manifestations, and the science of religion become perfect when\nit would discover Him who is the one life in a universe of death, Him who is the constant basis of an ever-changing\nworld. One who is the only Soul of which all souls are but delusive manifestations. Thus is it, through multiplicity\nand duality, that the ultimate unity is reached. Religion can go no farther. This is the goal of all science.\n\n\nAll science is bound to come to this conclusion in the long run. Manifestation, and not creation, is the word of\nscience today, and the Hindu is only glad that what he has been cherishing in his bosom for ages is going to be\ntaught in more forcible language, and with further light from the latest conclusions of science.\n\n\nDescend we now from the aspirations of philosophy to the religion of the ignorant. At the very outset, I may tell\nyou that there is no polytheism in India. In every temple, if one stands by and listens, one will find the worshippers\napplying all the attributes of God, including omnipresence, to the images. It is not polytheism, nor would the name\nhenotheism explain the situation. \"The rose called by any other name would smell as sweet.\" Names are not explanations.\n\n\nI remember, as a boy, hearing a Christian missionary preach to a crowd in India. Among other sweet things he was\ntelling them was that if he gave a blow to their idol with his stick, what could it do? One of his hearers sharply\nanswered, \"If I abuse your God, what can He do?\" “You would be punished,” said the preacher, \"when you die.\" \"So my\nidol will punish you when you die,\" retorted the Hindu.\n\n\nThe tree is known by its fruits. When I have seen amongst them that are called idolaters, men, the like of whom in\nmorality and spirituality and love I have never seen anywhere, I stop and ask myself, \"Can sin beget holiness?\"\n\n\nSuperstition is a great enemy of man, but bigotry is worse. Why does a Christian go to church? Why is the cross holy?\nWhy is the face turned toward the sky in prayer? Why are there so many images in the Catholic Church? Why are there\nso many images in the minds of Protestants when they pray? My brethren, we can no more think about anything without\na mental image than we can live without breathing. By the law of association, the material image calls up the mental\nidea and vice versa. This is why the Hindu uses an external symbol when he worships. He will tell you, it helps to\nkeep his mind fixed on the Being to whom he prays. He knows as well as you do that the image is not God, is not\nomnipresent. After all, how much does omnipresence mean to almost the whole world? It stands merely as a word,\na symbol. Has God superficial area? If not, when we repeat that word \"omnipresent\", we think of the extended sky or\nof space, that is all.\n\n\nAs we find that somehow or other, by the laws of our mental constitution, we have to associate our ideas of infinity\nwith the image of the blue sky, or of the sea, so we naturally connect our idea of holiness with the image of a\nchurch, a mosque, or a cross. The Hindus have associated the idea of holiness, purity, truth, omnipresence, and such\nother ideas with different images and forms. But with this difference that while some people devote their whole lives\nto their idol of a church and never rise higher, because with them religion means an intellectual assent to certain\ndoctrines and doing good to their fellows, the whole religion of the Hindu is centred in realisation. Man is to become\ndivine by realising the divine. Idols or temples or churches or books are only the supports, the helps, of his\nspiritual childhood: but on and on he must progress.\n\n\nHe must not stop anywhere. \"External worship, material worship,\" say the scriptures, \"is the lowest stage;\nstruggling to rise high, mental prayer is the next stage, but the highest stage is when the Lord has been realised.\"\nMark, the same earnest man who is kneeling before the idol tells you, \"Him the Sun cannot express, nor the moon, nor\nthe stars, the lightning cannot express Him, nor what we speak of as fire; through Him they shine.\" But he does not\nabuse any one's idol or call its worship sin. He recognises in it a necessary stage of life. \"The child is father of\nthe man.\" Would it be right for an old man to say that childhood is a sin or youth a sin?\n\n\nIf a man can realise his divine nature with the help of an image, would it be right to call that a sin? Nor even when\nhe has passed that stage, should he call it an error. To the Hindu, man is not travelling from error to truth, but\nfrom truth to truth, from lower to higher truth. To him all the religions, from the lowest fetishism to the highest\nabsolutism, mean so many attempts of the human soul to grasp and realise the Infinite, each determined by the\nconditions of its birth and association, and each of these marks a stage of progress; and every soul is a young eagle\nsoaring higher and higher, gathering more and more strength, till it reaches the Glorious Sun.\n\n\nUnity in variety is the plan of nature, and the Hindu has recognised it. Every other religion lays down certain\nfixed dogmas, and tries to force society to adopt them. It places before society only one coat which must fit Jack and\nJohn and Henry, all alike. If it does not fit John or Henry, he must go without a coat to cover his body. The Hindus\nhave discovered that the absolute can only be realised, or thought of, or stated, through the relative, and the images,\ncrosses, and crescents are simply so many symbols — so many pegs to hang the spiritual ideas on. It is not that this\nhelp is necessary for every one, but those that do not need it have no right to say that it is wrong. Nor is it\ncompulsory in Hinduism.\n\n\nOne thing I must tell you. Idolatry in India does not mean anything horrible. It is not the mother of harlots. On the\nother hand, it is the attempt of undeveloped minds to grasp high spiritual truths. The Hindus have their faults,\nthey sometimes have their exceptions; but mark this, they are always for punishing their own bodies, and never for\ncutting the throats of their neighbours. If the Hindu fanatic burns himself on the pyre, he never lights the fire of\nInquisition. And even this cannot be laid at the door of his religion any more than the burning of witches can be\nlaid at the door of Christianity.\n\n\nTo the Hindu, then, the whole world of religions is only a travelling, a coming up, of different men and women,\nthrough various conditions and circumstances, to the same goal. Every religion is only evolving a God out of the\nmaterial man, and the same God is the inspirer of all of them. Why, then, are there so many contradictions? They are\nonly apparent, says the Hindu. The contradictions come from the same truth adapting itself to the varying\ncircumstances of different natures.\n\n\nIt is the same light coming through glasses of different colours. And these little variations are necessary for\npurposes of adaptation. But in the heart of everything the same truth reigns. The Lord has declared to the Hindu in\nHis incarnation as Krishna, \"I am in every religion as the thread through a string of pearls. Wherever thou seest\nextraordinary holiness and extraordinary power raising and purifying humanity, know thou that I am there.\" And what\nhas been the result? I challenge the world to find, throughout the whole system of Sanskrit philosophy, any such\nexpression as that the Hindu alone will be saved and not others. Says Vyasa, \"We find perfect men even beyond the pale\nof our caste and creed.\" One thing more. How, then, can the Hindu, whose whole fabric of thought centres in God,\nbelieve in Buddhism which is agnostic, or in Jainism which is atheistic?\n\n\nThe Buddhists or the Jains do not depend upon God; but the whole force of their religion is directed to the great\ncentral truth in every religion, to evolve a God out of man. They have not seen the Father, but they have seen the\nSon. And he that hath seen the Son hath seen the Father also.\n\n\nThis, brethren, is a short sketch of the religious ideas of the Hindus. The Hindu may have failed to carry out all\nhis plans, but if there is ever to be a universal religion, it must be one which will have no location in place or\ntime; which will be infinite like the God it will preach, and whose sun will shine upon the followers of Krishna and\nof Christ, on saints and sinners alike; which will not be Brahminic or Buddhistic, Christian or Mohammedan, but the\nsum total of all these, and still have infinite space for development; which in its catholicity will embrace in its\ninfinite arms, and find a place for, every human being, from the lowest grovelling savage not far removed from the\nbrute, to the highest man towering by the virtues of his head and heart almost above humanity, making society stand\nin awe of him and doubt his human nature. It will be a religion which will have no place for persecution or\nintolerance in its polity, which will recognise divinity in every man and woman, and whose whole scope, whose whole\nforce, will be created in aiding humanity to realise its own true, divine nature.\n\n\nOffer such a religion, and all the nations will follow you. Asoka's council was a council of the Buddhist faith.\nAkbar's, though more to the purpose, was only a parlour-meeting. It was reserved for America to proclaim to all\nquarters of the globe that the Lord is in every religion.\n\n\nMay He who is the Brahman of the Hindus, the Ahura-Mazda of the Zoroastrians, the Buddha of the Buddhists, the\nJehovah of the Jews, the Father in Heaven of the Christians, give strength to you to carry out your noble idea!\nThe star arose in the East; it travelled steadily towards the West, sometimes dimmed and sometimes effulgent, till\nit made a circuit of the world; and now it is again rising on the very horizon of the East, the borders of the Sanpo,\na thousandfold more effulgent than it ever was before.\n\n\nHail, Columbia, motherland of liberty! It has been given to thee, who never dipped her hand in her neighbour’s blood,\nwho never found out that the shortest way of becoming rich was by robbing one’s neighbours, it has been given to thee\nto march at the vanguard of civilisation with the flag of harmony.",

and Judaism. They have all received tremendous shocks and all of them prove by their survival their internal strength.
But while Judaism failed to absorb Christianity and was driven out of its place of birth by its all-conquering
daughter, and a handful of Parsees is all that remains to tell the tale of their grand religion, sect after sect arose
in India and seemed to shake the religion of the Vedas to its very foundations, but like the waters of the seashore
in a tremendous earthquake it receded only for a while, only to return in an all-absorbing flood, a thousand times more
vigorous, and when the tumult of the rush was over, these sects were all sucked in, absorbed, and assimilated into
the immense body of the mother faith.</p>

They hold that the Vedas are without beginning
and without end. It may sound ludicrous to this audience, how a book can be without beginning or end. But by the Vedas
no books are meant. They mean the accumulated treasury of spiritual laws discovered by different persons in different
times. Just as the law of gravitation existed before its discovery, and would exist if all humanity forgot it, so is it
with the laws that govern the spiritual world. The moral, ethical, and spiritual relations between soul and soul and
between individual spirits and the Father of all spirits, were there before their discovery, and would remain even if
we forgot them.</p>

I am glad to tell this audience
that some of the very greatest of them were women. Here it may be said that these laws as laws may be without end,
but they must have had a beginning. The Vedas teach us that creation is without beginning or end. Science is said to
have proved that the sum total of cosmic energy is always the same. Then, if there was a time when nothing existed,
where was all this manifested energy? Some say it was in a potential form in God. In that case God is sometimes
potential and sometimes kinetic, which would make Him mutable. Everything mutable is a compound, and everything
compound must undergo that change which is called destruction. So God would die, which is absurd. Therefore there
never was a time when there was no creation.</p>

parallel to each other. God is the ever active providence, by whose power systems after systems are being evolved out

moon, the Lord created like the suns and moons of previous cycles.” And this agrees with modern science.</p>

idea of a body. Am I, then, nothing but a combination of material substances? The Vedas declare, “No”. I am a spirit
living in a body. I am not the body. The body will die, but I shall not die. Here am I in this body; it will fall, but
I shall go on living. I had also a past. The soul was not created, for creation means a combination which means a
certain future dissolution. If then the soul was created, it must die. Some are born happy, enjoy perfect health, with
beautiful body, mental vigour and all wants supplied. Others are born miserable, some are without hands or feet,
others again are idiots and only drag on a wretched existence. Why, if they are all created, why does a just and
merciful God create one happy and another unhappy, why is He so partial? Nor would it mend matters in the least to
hold that those who are miserable in this life will be happy in a future one. Why should a man be miserable even here
in the reign of a just and merciful God?</p>

Here are two parallel lines
of existence — one of the mind, the other of matter. If matter and its transformations answer for all that we have,
there is no necessity for supposing the existence of a soul. But it cannot be proved that thought has been evolved out
of matter, and if a philosophical monism is inevitable, spiritual monism is certainly logical and no less desirable
than a materialistic monism; but neither of these is necessary here.</p>

configuration, through which a peculiar mind alone can act in a peculiar way. There are other tendencies peculiar to
a soul caused by its past actions. And a soul with a certain tendency would by the laws of affinity take birth in a
body which is the fittest instrument for the display of that tendency. This is in accord with science, for science
wants to explain everything by habit, and habit is got through repetitions. So repetitions are necessary to explain
the natural habits of a new-born soul. And since they were not obtained in this present life, they must have come down
from past lives.</p>

Taking all these for granted, how is it that I do not remember anything of my past life ?
This can be easily explained. I am now speaking English. It is not my mother tongue, in fact no words of my mother
tongue are now present in my consciousness; but let me try to bring them up, and they rush in. That shows that
consciousness is only the surface of the mental ocean, and within its depths are stored up all our experiences. Try
and struggle, they would come up and you would be conscious even of your past life.</p>

Verification is the perfect proof of a theory, and here is the challenge
thrown to the world by the Rishis. We have discovered the secret by which the very depths of the ocean of memory can
be stirred up — try it and you would get a complete reminiscence of your past life.</p>

Him the sword cannot pierce — him the fire cannot burn — him the water
cannot melt — him the air cannot dry. The Hindu believes that every soul is a circle whose circumference is nowhere,
but whose centre is located in the body, and that death means the change of this centre from body to body. Nor is the
soul bound by the conditions of matter. In its very essence it is free, unbounded, holy, pure, and perfect. But
somehow or other it finds itself tied down to matter, and thinks of itself as matter.</p>

How can the
perfect soul be deluded into the belief that it is imperfect? We have been told that the Hindus shirk the question
and say that no such question can be there. Some thinkers want to answer it by positing one or more quasi-perfect
beings, and use big scientific names to fill up the gap. But naming is not explaining. The question remains the same.
How can the perfect become the quasi-perfect; how can the pure, the absolute, change even a microscopic particle of
its nature? But the Hindu is sincere. He does not want to take shelter under sophistry. He is brave enough to face
the question in a manly fashion; and his answer is: “I do not know. I do not know how the perfect being, the soul,
came to think of itself as imperfect, as joined to and conditioned by matter.” But the fact is a fact for all that.
It is a fact in everybody’s consciousness that one thinks of oneself as the body. The Hindu does not attempt to
explain why one thinks one is the body. The answer that it is the will of God is no explanation. This is nothing more
than what the Hindu says, “I do not know.”</p>

one body to another. The present is determined by our past actions, and the future by the present. The soul will go
on evolving up or reverting back from birth to birth and death to death. But here is another question: Is man a tiny
boat in a tempest, raised one moment on the foamy crest of a billow and dashed down into a yawning chasm the next,
rolling to and fro at the mercy of good and bad actions — a powerless, helpless wreck in an ever-raging, ever-rushing,
uncompromising current of cause and effect; a little moth placed under the wheel of causation which rolls on crushing
everything in its way and waits not for the widow’s tears or the orphan’s cry? The heart sinks at the idea, yet this
is the law of Nature. Is there no hope? Is there no escape? — was the cry that went up from the bottom of the heart
of despair. It reached the throne of mercy, and words of hope and consolation came down and inspired a Vedic sage,
and he stood up before the world and in trumpet voice proclaimed the glad tidings: “Hear, ye children of immortal
bliss! even ye that reside in higher spheres! I have found the Ancient One who is beyond all darkness, all delusion:
knowing Him alone you shall be saved from death over again.” “Children of immortal bliss” — what a sweet, what a
hopeful name! Allow me to call you, brethren, by that sweet name — heirs of immortal bliss — yea, the Hindu refuses
to call you sinners. Ye are the Children of God, the sharers of immortal bliss, holy and perfect beings. Ye divinities
on earth — sinners! It is a sin to call a man so; it is a standing libel on human nature. Come up, O lions, and shake
off the delusion that you are sheep; you are souls immortal, spirits free, blest and eternal; ye are not matter,
ye are not bodies; matter is your servant, not you the servant of matter.</p>

to birth, but grant me this, that I may love Thee without the hope of reward — love unselfishly for love’s sake.”
One of the disciples of Krishna, the then Emperor of India, was driven from his kingdom by his enemies and had to take
shelter with his queen in a forest in the Himalayas, and there one day the queen asked him how it was that he, the
most virtuous of men, should suffer so much misery. Yudhishthira answered, “Behold, my queen, the Himalayas, how grand
and beautiful they are; I love them. They do not give me anything, but my nature is to love the grand, the beautiful,
therefore I love them. Similarly, I love the Lord. He is the source of all beauty, of all sublimity. He is the only
object to be loved; my nature is to love Him, and therefore I love. I do not pray for anything; I do not ask for
anything. Let Him place me wherever He likes. I must love Him for love’s sake. I cannot trade in love.”</p>

So purity is the
condition of His mercy. How does that mercy act? He reveals Himself to the pure heart; the pure and the stainless
see God, yea, even in this life; then and then only all the crookedness of the heart is made straight. Then all doubt
ceases. He is no more the freak of a terrible law of causation. This is the very centre, the very vital conception of
Hinduism. The Hindu does not want to live upon words and theories. If there are existences beyond the ordinary
sensuous existence, he wants to come face to face with them. If there is a soul in him which is not matter, if there
is an all-merciful universal Soul, he will go to Him direct. He must see Him, and that alone can destroy all doubts.
So the best proof a Hindu sage gives about the soul, about God, is: “I have seen the soul; I have seen God.” And that
is the only condition of perfection. The Hindu religion does not consist in struggles and attempts to believe a
certain doctrine or dogma, but in realising — not in believing, but in being and becoming.</p>

absolute, and the absolute cannot be two or three. It cannot have any qualities. It cannot be an individual. And so
when a soul becomes perfect and absolute, it must become one with Brahman, and it would only realise the Lord as the
perfection, the reality, of its own nature and existence, the existence absolute, knowledge absolute, and bliss
absolute. We have often and often read this called the losing of individuality and becoming a stock or a stone.</p>

discovering one energy of which all others are but manifestations, and the science of religion become perfect when
it would discover Him who is the one life in a universe of death, Him who is the constant basis of an ever-changing
world. One who is the only Soul of which all souls are but delusive manifestations. Thus is it, through multiplicity

Among other sweet things he was
telling them was that if he gave a blow to their idol with his stick, what could it do? One of his hearers sharply
answered, “If I abuse your God, what can He do?” “You would be punished,” said the preacher, “when you die.” “So my
idol will punish you when you die,” retorted the Hindu.</p>

When I have seen amongst them that are called idolaters, men, the like of whom in
morality and spirituality and love I have never seen anywhere, I stop and ask myself, “Can sin beget holiness?”</p>

Why does a Christian go to church? Why is the cross holy?
Why is the face turned toward the sky in prayer? Why are there so many images in the Catholic Church? Why are there
so many images in the minds of Protestants when they pray? My brethren, we can no more think about anything without
a mental image than we can live without breathing. By the law of association, the material image calls up the mental
idea and vice versa. This is why the Hindu uses an external symbol when he worships. He will tell you, it helps to
keep his mind fixed on the Being to whom he prays. He knows as well as you do that the image is not God, is not
omnipresent. After all, how much does omnipresence mean to almost the whole world? It stands merely as a word,
a symbol. Has God superficial area? If not, when we repeat that word “omnipresent”, we think of the extended sky or
of space, that is all.</p>

with the image of the blue sky, or of the sea, so we naturally connect our idea of holiness with the image of a
church, a mosque, or a cross. The Hindus have associated the idea of holiness, purity, truth, omnipresence, and such
other ideas with different images and forms. But with this difference that while some people devote their whole lives
to their idol of a church and never rise higher, because with them religion means an intellectual assent to certain
doctrines and doing good to their fellows, the whole religion of the Hindu is centred in realisation. Man is to become
divine by realising the divine. Idols or temples or churches or books are only the supports, the helps, of his
spiritual childhood: but on and on he must progress.</p>

struggling to rise high, mental prayer is the next stage, but the highest stage is when the Lord has been realised.”
Mark, the same earnest man who is kneeling before the idol tells you, “Him the Sun cannot express, nor the moon, nor
the stars, the lightning cannot express Him, nor what we speak of as fire; through Him they shine.” But he does not
abuse any one’s idol or call its worship sin. He recognises in it a necessary stage of life. “The child is father of
the man.” Would it be right for an old man to say that childhood is a sin or youth a sin?</p>

Nor even when
he has passed that stage, should he call it an error. To the Hindu, man is not travelling from error to truth, but
from truth to truth, from lower to higher truth. To him all the religions, from the lowest fetishism to the highest
absolutism, mean so many attempts of the human soul to grasp and realise the Infinite, each determined by the
conditions of its birth and association, and each of these marks a stage of progress; and every soul is a young eagle
soaring higher and higher, gathering more and more strength, till it reaches the Glorious Sun.</p>

Every other religion lays down certain
fixed dogmas, and tries to force society to adopt them. It places before society only one coat which must fit Jack and
John and Henry, all alike. If it does not fit John or Henry, he must go without a coat to cover his body. The Hindus
have discovered that the absolute can only be realised, or thought of, or stated, through the relative, and the images,
crosses, and crescents are simply so many symbols — so many pegs to hang the spiritual ideas on. It is not that this
help is necessary for every one, but those that do not need it have no right to say that it is wrong. Nor is it
compulsory in Hinduism.</p>
</p>
<p data-id="0,1,2,0,1,39:body-id-external:0:main" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>One thing I must tell you. Idolatry in India does not mean anything horrible. It is not the mother of harlots. On the
other hand, it is the attempt of undeveloped minds to grasp high spiritual truths. The Hindus have their faults,
they sometimes have their exceptions; but mark this, they are always for punishing their own bodies, and never for
cutting the throats of their neighbours. If the Hindu fanatic burns himself on the pyre, he never lights the fire of
Inquisition. And even this cannot be laid at the door of his religion any more than the burning of witches can be
laid at the door of Christianity.</p>

through various conditions and circumstances, to the same goal. Every religion is only evolving a God out of the
material man, and the same God is the inspirer of all of them. Why, then, are there so many contradictions? They are
only apparent, says the Hindu. The contradictions come from the same truth adapting itself to the varying
circumstances of different natures.</p>
</p>
<p data-id="0,1,2,0,1,41:body-id-external:0:main" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>It is the same light coming through glasses of different colours. And these little variations are necessary for
purposes of adaptation. But in the heart of everything the same truth reigns. The Lord has declared to the Hindu in
His incarnation as Krishna, “I am in every religion as the thread through a string of pearls. Wherever thou seest
extraordinary holiness and extraordinary power raising and purifying humanity, know thou that I am there.” And what
has been the result? I challenge the world to find, throughout the whole system of Sanskrit philosophy, any such
expression as that the Hindu alone will be saved and not others. Says Vyasa, “We find perfect men even beyond the pale
of our caste and creed.” One thing more. How, then, can the Hindu, whose whole fabric of thought centres in God,
believe in Buddhism which is agnostic, or in Jainism which is atheistic?</p>

central truth in every religion, to evolve a God out of man. They have not seen the Father, but they have seen the
Son. And he that hath seen the Son hath seen the Father also.</p>
</p>

The Hindu may have failed to carry out all
his plans, but if there is ever to be a universal religion, it must be one which will have no location in place or
time; which will be infinite like the God it will preach, and whose sun will shine upon the followers of Krishna and
of Christ, on saints and sinners alike; which will not be Brahminic or Buddhistic, Christian or Mohammedan, but the
sum total of all these, and still have infinite space for development; which in its catholicity will embrace in its
infinite arms, and find a place for, every human being, from the lowest grovelling savage not far removed from the
brute, to the highest man towering by the virtues of his head and heart almost above humanity, making society stand
in awe of him and doubt his human nature. It will be a religion which will have no place for persecution or
intolerance in its polity, which will recognise divinity in every man and woman, and whose whole scope, whose whole
force, will be created in aiding humanity to realise its own true, divine nature.</p>

Asoka’s council was a council of the Buddhist faith.
Akbar’s, though more to the purpose, was only a parlour-meeting. It was reserved for America to proclaim to all
quarters of the globe that the Lord is in every religion.</p>

        fpm-ui.dark-mode behaviour:

        fpm-ui.dark-mode is a boolean, default false, it tells the UI to show
        the UI in dark or light mode. Themes should use this variable to decide
        which mode to show in UI.

        fpm-ui.dark-mode-follow-system, boolean, default true, keeps track if
        we are reading the value of `dark-mode` from system preference, or user
        has overridden the system preference.

        These two variables must not be set by ftd code directly, but they must
        use `$event-click$: message-host enable-dark-mode`, to ignore system
        preference and use dark mode. `$event-click$: message-host
        disable-dark-mode` to ignore system preference and use light mode and
        `$event-click$: message-host follow-system-dark-mode` to ignore user
        preference and start following system preference.

        we use a cookie: `fpm-dark-mode` to store the preference. The cookie can
        have three values:

           cookie missing /          user wants us to honour system preference
               system-light          and currently its light.

           system-dark               follow system and currently its dark.

           light:                    user prefers light

           dark:                     user prefers light

        We use cookie instead of localstorage so in future `fpm-repo` can see
        users preferences up front and renders the HTML on service wide
        following user's preference.
